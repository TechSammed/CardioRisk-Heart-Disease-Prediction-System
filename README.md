# CardioRisk – Heart Disease Risk Prediction System

CardioRisk is an end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts the **risk of heart disease** based on clinical parameters.  
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using **Streamlit**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Early identification of heart disease risk can help in timely medical consultation.  
This project aims to build a **machine learning–based risk prediction system** using commonly available clinical features.
